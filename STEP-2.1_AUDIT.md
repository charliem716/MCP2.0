Tests:       2 skipped, 134 passed, 136 total
Time:        71.707 s
```

- New query-cache tests: 10 passed

## Coverage Analysis

Current coverage: 20% (all metrics)
- No coverage regression detected
- New file query-cache.ts: 98.14% statement coverage

## Implementation Verification

### Key Implementation Details
1. **LRU Eviction**: Uses Map with separate keyQueue for proper ordering
2. **TTL Handling**: Checks timestamp on get(), removes expired entries
3. **Cache Key Generation**: Normalizes and sorts array fields for consistency
4. **Statistics**: Tracks hits, misses, calculates hit rate
5. **Integration**: Non-breaking addition to EventCacheManager

### Performance Impact
- Cache hits avoid expensive buffer traversal
- MD5 hashing is fast for cache key generation
- Group-specific invalidation maintains data freshness

## Discrepancies Found

None - All requirements from plan and checklist have been implemented as specified.

## Summary

✅ **STEP-2.1 implementation complete and verified**
- All checklist items completed
- Code quality checks pass (lint warnings only)
- Type safety maintained
- Test coverage maintained
- No blocking issues found
