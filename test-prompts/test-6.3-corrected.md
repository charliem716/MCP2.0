### Test 6.3: Event Statistics Analysis (CORRECTED)
```
TEST: Event Statistics Analysis
Please execute the following test and report results:
1. Use get_event_statistics to get baseline
2. Use list_components to find 5 components with controls
3. Create change group "stats-test" with pollRate: 0.1
4. Add 4 valid controls from each of the 5 components (20 total)
   - Use list_controls first to verify control names exist
   - Use actual control names, not assumed patterns
5. Make rapid changes to all 20 controls using set_control_values
6. Wait 2 seconds for auto-polling to capture events
7. Destroy the change group to stop polling
8. Use get_event_statistics again
9. Calculate the event increase

EXPECTED OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Baseline Statistics:
  * Total Events: [number]
  * Unique Controls: [number]
- Components Used: [list 5 names]
- Controls Added: 20 (4 per component)
- All Controls Valid: [yes/no - verify with list_controls first]
- Set Control Results:
  * Successful: [number]
  * Failed: [number with reasons]
- Wait Period: 2 seconds
- Change Group Destroyed: [yes/no]
- Updated Statistics:
  * Total Events: [new total]
  * Event Increase: [new total - baseline]
  * Unique Controls: [number]
- Statistics Notes:
  * Auto-polling at 0.1s generated additional events
  * Event count includes both manual changes and poll updates
- Tool Errors: [any errors with details]
- Overall Result: [PASS if all controls set and events recorded]

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- The poll_change_group showAll parameter must be a boolean (true/false), not a string
- Use actual control names from list_controls, don't assume naming patterns
- Event count will be higher than 20 due to automatic polling at 10Hz
- Always destroy change groups after testing to stop polling
```

## Key Corrections Made:

1. **Removed manual poll step** - Change groups auto-poll, no need for manual poll
2. **Added verification step** - Must use list_controls to verify control names exist
3. **Fixed expectations** - Event count will be >20 due to auto-polling at 10Hz
4. **Added wait period** - 2 seconds to let auto-polling capture events
5. **Added destroy step timing** - Destroy group BEFORE counting to stop polling
6. **Clarified showAll parameter** - Must be boolean, not string
7. **Removed assumed control names** - Test must use actual control names from list_controls

## Alternative Test Design (Predictable Event Count):

```
TEST: Event Statistics Analysis (MANUAL POLL VERSION)
For predictable event counts without auto-polling interference:
1. Get baseline statistics
2. Create change group WITHOUT specifying pollRate (no auto-poll)
3. Add 20 controls
4. Set all 20 control values
5. Manually poll with poll_change_group {groupId: "stats-test", showAll: false}
6. Immediately destroy change group
7. Get updated statistics
8. Verify exactly 20 new events recorded
```

This version would give exactly 20 events since there's no automatic polling.
