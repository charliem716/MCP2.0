# BUG-039 LRU Cache Test Summary

## Test File

`tests/unit/mcp/state/lru-cache-bug039-verification.test.ts`

## Purpose

This test file specifically verifies that the simplified LRU cache implementation from BUG-039 meets
all the expected requirements while confirming that complex features have been intentionally
removed.

## What the Tests Verify

### Core Requirements (All Passing ✓)

1. **Stores key-value pairs**
   - Handles various data types (strings, numbers, objects, arrays, null)
   - Maintains correct key-value associations
   - Properly updates existing values

2. **Evicts least recently used items when full**
   - Removes oldest item when cache reaches capacity
   - Updates LRU order on get() operations
   - Updates LRU order on set() operations
   - Correctly tracks eviction count in statistics

3. **Provides get/set/delete operations**
   - get(): Returns values or null, tracks hits/misses
   - set(): Always returns true, manages cache size
   - delete(): Returns boolean success, removes entries

4. **Has configurable size limit**
   - Accepts custom maxEntries in constructor
   - Defaults to 1000 if not specified
   - Enforces limit during all operations

### Verified Absent Features (Simplification Success ✓)

The tests confirm these complex features are NOT present:

- **No TTL support**: removeExpired() is a no-op returning 0
- **No memory tracking**: memoryUsage always returns 0
- **No eviction policies**: Only LRU is available
- **No operation events**: Only 'eviction' and 'expiration' events for compatibility
- **No memory limits**: Constructor only accepts maxEntries
- **No item-specific options**: set() only accepts key and value
- **No priority-based eviction**: All items treated equally

### Additional Verified Features

- **Utility methods**: has(), clear(), keys(), values(), size property
- **Statistics**: Tracks hits, misses, evictions, hit ratio, uptime
- **Shutdown**: Clears cache and removes listeners
- **Performance**: O(1) operations, handles 10,000+ operations efficiently

## Test Results

- **Total Tests**: 38
- **Passed**: 38 ✓
- **Failed**: 0
- **Runtime**: ~250ms

## Conclusion

The simplified LRU cache implementation successfully meets all core requirements from BUG-039 while
removing unnecessary complexity. The implementation is fast, maintainable, and provides all
essential LRU cache functionality.
