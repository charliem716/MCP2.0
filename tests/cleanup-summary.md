# Test Directory Cleanup Summary

## Date: 2025-07-20

### Actions Taken:

1. **Created new directory structure:**
   - `tests/integration/qsys/` - For Q-SYS integration tests
   - `tests/manual/` - For manual testing scripts

2. **Moved 18 test files from root to appropriate directories:**

   **To `tests/integration/qsys/` (git-tracked):**
   - test-connection.mjs
   - test-component-control.mjs

   **To `tests/manual/` (untracked development scripts):**
   - Control-related tests (7 files)
   - MCP integration tests (9 files)

3. **Updated references:**
   - `package.json`: Added `test:connection` script
   - Updated all markdown documentation to use new paths

### Result:

- ✅ Root directory is now clean of test files
- ✅ Test files are properly organized
- ✅ Git-tracked tests preserved in integration directory
- ✅ Manual test scripts available but separated
- ✅ All documentation updated

### Next Steps:

Consider converting valuable manual test scripts into proper Jest/Vitest integration tests.
