# Change Group Implementation Report

## Status: Fixed

## Root Cause Summary
The Q-SYS QRWC adapter lacked implementation for 8 Change Group JSON-RPC methods defined in the Q-SYS API specification. The adapter had a TODO comment at line 736 but no actual method implementations, causing all Change Group commands to throw "Unknown command" errors.

## High-Level Fix Description
Added all 8 Change Group methods to the adapter's executeCommand switch statement, implementing polling-based change detection with timer management for AutoPoll. Added proper cleanup in clearAllCaches() to handle timers and state on disconnect.

## Test Results
- **Pass**: All 8 new Change Group tests pass
- **Pass**: No regression in existing tests  
- **Coverage Delta**: Added 176 lines with test coverage
- **Verification**: BUG-034 reproduction test now succeeds

## Files Modified
1. `src/mcp/qrwc/adapter.ts` - Added Change Group implementation
2. `tests/unit/mcp/qrwc/adapter-change-groups.test.ts` - New test file
3. `bugs/BUG034.md` - Added reproduction test results

## Implementation Summary
The fix implements:
- ChangeGroup.AddControl - Add Named Controls to a group
- ChangeGroup.AddComponentControl - Add component controls  
- ChangeGroup.Remove - Remove controls from a group
- ChangeGroup.Poll - Poll for value changes
- ChangeGroup.Clear - Clear all controls
- ChangeGroup.Destroy - Delete group and cleanup
