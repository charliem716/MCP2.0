# STEP-1.2 Audit Report

## Requirements Reconciliation

### Plan Requirements (from FULL_FUNCTIONALITY_PLAN.md)

- ✅ Create `tests/integration/event-cache-real-world.test.ts`
- ✅ Implement 33Hz polling simulation (30 controls for 1 minute)
- ✅ Verify ~60,000 events handled without drops
- ✅ Test query performance (<100ms recent, <500ms large dataset)
- ✅ Verify compression activates when needed
- ✅ Verify disk spillover activates at threshold

### Checklist Requirements (from FULL_FUNCTIONALITY_CHECKLIST.md)

- ✅ Create integration test file
- ✅ 33Hz polling simulation with 30 controls
- ✅ Verify event handling and memory limits
- ✅ Test query performance metrics
- ✅ Verify compression activation
- ✅ Verify disk spillover activation
- ✅ Add proper test cleanup

### Report Verification (STEP-1.2_REPORT.md)

All requirements marked as complete in report. Performance results documented:

- Successfully handled ~56,000 events/minute
- Query latency: 2-18ms (exceeds requirements)
- Memory usage stayed within limits
- No memory leaks after cleanup

## Diff Statistics

**Total Changes:** 74 files changed, +7112 insertions, -1000 deletions

⚠️ **Large diff:** Total lines changed: 8112 (exceeds 800 LOC threshold)

### Key Files Changed:

- `tests/integration/event-cache-real-world.test.ts` (+429 lines) - New integration test
- `src/mcp/state/event-cache/manager.ts` (+1343 lines total) - Added global statistics
- `src/mcp/state/event-cache/compression.ts` (+220 lines) - Added isActive() method
- Multiple test and documentation files

## Static Analysis Results

### ESLint ❌

- **1003 errors, 2322 warnings**
- Major issues:
  - Parsing errors for debug files not in tsconfig
  - Type safety violations (@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any)
  - Unused variables and parameters
  - Console statements in test files

### Prettier ❌

- **351 files with formatting issues**
- Requires `--write` to fix

### TypeScript ❌

- **10 type errors** in:
  - `src/mcp/state/event-cache/__tests__/manager.test.ts` (8 errors)
  - `src/mcp/state/event-cache/manager.ts` (2 errors)
- Issues with getStatistics() method signatures and property access

## Test Results ❌

### Test Execution

- **Failed tests:** Multiple test suites failed
- **Coverage:** 64.73% lines, 48.06% statements, 61.48% functions, 64% branches

### Coverage Delta

- Cannot calculate delta (no coverage file on main branch)
- Current coverage below typical project standards

## Summary

| Check                 | Result | Notes                                 |
| --------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Requirements Complete | ✅     | All STEP-1.2 requirements implemented |
| Diff Size             | ⚠️     | 8112 lines changed (large diff)       |
| ESLint                | ❌     | 1003 errors, needs fixes              |
| Prettier              | ❌     | 351 files need formatting             |
| TypeScript            | ❌     | 10 type errors to resolve             |
| Tests                 | ❌     | Multiple test failures                |
| Coverage              | ⚠️     | 64.73% (no baseline for comparison)   |

## Blocking Issues

1. TypeScript compilation errors prevent build
2. ESLint errors indicate code quality issues
3. Test failures suggest functionality problems
