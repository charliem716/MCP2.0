## Recent Changes

### STEP-2.1 Query Optimization
- ✅ Successfully implemented LRU query cache
- ✅ All new tests passing
- ✅ No regression in existing functionality
- ✅ Type safety maintained

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Wait for Q-SYS Core to boot up (~5 minutes)
   - Re-run integration tests once Core is online

2. **Near-term Improvements**:
   - Address coverage gap (currently ~74%, target 80%)
   - Consider reducing lint warnings from 560

3. **No Critical Issues**:
   - No security vulnerabilities
   - No type errors
   - Build process stable
   - Unit tests passing

## Health Score: 8/10

The project is healthy with only temporary integration test failures due to Q-SYS Core being offline. All other systems are functioning correctly.
