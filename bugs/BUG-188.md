# BUG-188: Fix Remaining ESLint Errors - Max Depth Violations

**Status**: Open  
**Severity**: High  
**Priority**: P0 (Critical)  
**Component**: tools/controls  
**Reported Date**: 2025-08-09  
**Reporter**: System Analysis  
**Assignee**: Unassigned

## Summary

3 ESLint errors remain in `src/mcp/tools/controls.ts` due to excessive nesting depth (max-depth rule violations).

## Description

Following the resolution of BUG-176, 3 critical ESLint errors persist:
- Line 758: Blocks nested 5 levels deep (max: 4)
- Line 771: Blocks nested 6 levels deep (max: 4)  
- Line 783: Blocks nested 5 levels deep (max: 4)

These errors prevent the codebase from passing ESLint checks and indicate overly complex code structure.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Run `npm run lint`
2. Observe 3 errors in `src/mcp/tools/controls.ts`

## Expected Behavior

- 0 ESLint errors
- Code passes all linting checks
- Nesting depth ≤ 4 levels

## Actual Behavior

- 3 ESLint errors blocking CI/CD
- Code fails linting due to excessive nesting

## Environment

- **File**: `src/mcp/tools/controls.ts`
- **Lines**: 758, 771, 783
- **Rule**: max-depth (max: 4)

## Root Cause Analysis

The `executeInternal` method in SetControlValuesTool has excessive nesting due to:
- Multiple conditional checks
- Nested try-catch blocks
- Deep control flow logic

## Proposed Solution

Refactor the deeply nested code by:
1. Extract nested logic into separate methods
2. Use early returns to reduce nesting
3. Combine related conditions
4. Extract validation logic

## Test Cases

- [ ] ESLint passes with 0 errors
- [ ] Functionality unchanged after refactoring
- [ ] All existing tests pass

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] 0 ESLint errors in controls.ts
- [ ] Max nesting depth ≤ 4
- [ ] No regression in functionality
