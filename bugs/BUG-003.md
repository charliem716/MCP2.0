# BUG-003: Missing Q-SYS Authentication Implementation

**Date Reported:** 2024-01-09  
**Severity:** High  
**Status:** Open  
**Reporter:** System Verification  
**Component:** QRWC Client  

## Description
The QRWC client accepts username and password configuration options but never uses them to authenticate with the Q-SYS Core. Q-SYS requires authentication for control operations, making this a critical missing feature.

## Current Implementation
```typescript
// Options are collected but never used:
this.options = {
  username: options.username || config.qsys.username,
  password: options.password || config.qsys.password,
  // ...
};
```

## Missing Authentication Flow
According to Q-SYS Remote Control documentation, after WebSocket connection:
1. Send authentication request with username/password
2. Wait for authentication response
3. Only proceed with control operations after successful auth

## Expected Implementation
```typescript
// After WebSocket connection established:
private async authenticate(): Promise<void> {
  const authRequest = {
    jsonrpc: '2.0',
    method: 'Logon',
    params: {
      User: this.options.username,
      Password: this.options.password
    },
    id: this.getNextRequestId()
  };
  
  const response = await this.sendCommand(authRequest);
  if (!response.result?.success) {
    throw new QSysError('Authentication failed', QSysErrorCode.AUTHENTICATION_FAILED);
  }
}
```

## Impact
- Cannot perform any control operations on Q-SYS Core
- Connection appears successful but commands will fail
- No indication to user that authentication is required
- Security credentials configured but ignored

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Configure username/password in environment
2. Connect to Q-SYS Core
3. Attempt any control operation
4. Operation fails due to lack of authentication

## Acceptance Criteria
- Authentication performed automatically after connection
- Clear error if authentication fails
- Credentials properly sent to Q-SYS Core
- Authentication state tracked
- Re-authentication on reconnect

## References
- Q-SYS Remote Control Protocol documentation
- QRC authentication requirements

## Priority
High - System cannot function without proper authentication to Q-SYS Core.
