# BUG-080: ESLint errors in Step 2.2 implementation

## Summary
Step 2.2 implementation has multiple ESLint errors that must be fixed before deployment.

## Evidence
Running `npx eslint src/mcp/state/event-cache/*.ts src/mcp/state/event-cache/__tests__/*.ts` reveals:
- 170 errors and 24 warnings in event-cache module
- Main issues:
  - Type safety violations (`@typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-*`)
  - Missing type imports (`@typescript-eslint/consistent-type-imports`)
  - Complexity violations (max-statements, complexity)
  - Unused variables
  - Missing await expressions in async functions

## Root Cause
The implementation focused on functionality but didn't maintain code quality standards:
1. Heavy use of `any` types and unsafe type assertions
2. Complex methods exceeding statement/complexity limits
3. Inconsistent type imports
4. Test functions marked async without await

## Proposed Fix
1. Fix type imports to use `import type` where appropriate
2. Replace `any` types with proper type definitions
3. Refactor complex methods (handleMemoryPressure, compressBufferEvents)
4. Remove unnecessary async keywords from test functions
5. Fix unused variables and parameters
6. Use nullish coalescing instead of logical OR where appropriate

## Impact
- Cannot deploy Step 2.2 with lint errors
- Type safety violations could lead to runtime errors
- Complex methods are hard to maintain

## Priority
High - Blocks Step 2.2 completion
