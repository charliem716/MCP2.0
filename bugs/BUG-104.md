# BUG-104: ESLint Parsing Errors for Multiple Source Files

## Summary
ESLint reports 8 parsing errors for TypeScript files in src/agent/, src/api/, and src/shared/ directories, indicating these files are not included in the TypeScript project configuration.

## Severity
Medium

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Run `npm run lint`
2. Observe parsing errors for 8 files

## Expected Behavior
- All source files should be lintable
- No parsing errors from ESLint

## Actual Behavior
- 8 files report parsing errors
- Files not found by TypeScript project service
- 480 additional warnings in linting

## Root Cause
The affected files are not included in `tsconfig.json`, causing the TypeScript ESLint parser to fail when processing these files.

## Proposed Solution
1. Update `tsconfig.json` to include all source directories
2. Ensure `src/agent/`, `src/api/`, and other directories are in the include patterns
3. Verify all TypeScript files are covered by the configuration

## Code Location
- `/tsconfig.json` - needs updated include patterns
- Files in `/src/agent/`, `/src/api/`, `/src/shared/` experiencing parsing errors

## Related Issues
- Prevents proper linting of affected files
- May hide actual code issues in unlinted files
- Contributes to overall build failure
