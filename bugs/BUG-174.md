# BUG-174: Final Production Validation and Checklist

**Status**: Open  
**Severity**: High  
**Priority**: P1 (High)  
**Component**: validation, production-readiness  
**Reported Date**: 2025-08-07  
**Reporter**: Assistant  
**Assignee**: Unassigned

## Summary

Final validation and production readiness checklist must be completed before deployment.

## Description

Final validation needed:
- All critical bugs resolved
- Integration testing complete
- Performance benchmarks met
- Security review passed
- Documentation complete
- Deployment tested

This is the final gate before production deployment.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Review all bug fixes
2. Run complete test suite
3. Perform integration testing
4. Security audit
5. Documentation review
6. Deployment dry run

## Expected Behavior

All items checked and passing:
- ✅ 95%+ test coverage
- ✅ Zero critical bugs
- ✅ Performance targets met
- ✅ Security validated
- ✅ Documentation complete
- ✅ Deployment successful

## Actual Behavior

Checklist not yet complete - validation needed

## Environment

- **Target**: Production
- **Validation Environment**: Staging

## Error Logs/Stack Trace

N/A - Validation checklist

## Root Cause Analysis

Final validation step before production

## Proposed Solution

## Related Issues

- Depends on: BUG-160 through BUG-173
- Blocks: Production deployment

## Additional Context

- Final gate before production
- Must have all sign-offs
- No exceptions for critical items
- Document any known issues

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All checklist items complete
- [ ] No critical issues remaining
