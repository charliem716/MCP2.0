# BUG-002: Missing Unit Test Implementation

**Date Reported:** 2024-01-09  
**Severity:** High  
**Status:** âœ… RESOLVED  
**Reporter:** System Verification  
**Component:** Testing Infrastructure  
**Date Resolved:** 2024-01-09  

## Description
Jest testing framework is configured in Phase 1.1, but no actual unit tests have been implemented. The `tests/unit/` directory is empty despite having multiple components that require testing.

## Current State
- Jest is properly configured in `jest.config.ts`
- Test setup file exists at `tests/setup.ts`
- Directory structure is in place:
  - `tests/unit/` (empty)
  - `tests/integration/` (empty)
  - `tests/e2e/` (empty)

## Missing Test Coverage
1. **QRWC Client Tests**
   - Connection management
   - Retry logic
   - Heartbeat mechanism
   - Event emission
   - Error handling

2. **QRC Commands Tests**
   - All 20+ command methods
   - Parameter validation
   - Error scenarios
   - Change group management

3. **Utility Tests**
   - Logger functionality
   - Environment configuration
   - Error handler
   - Type validation

4. **Type Tests**
   - Type definitions accuracy
   - Interface compliance
   - Enum coverage

## Impact
- No automated testing capability
- Cannot verify code changes don't break functionality
- Reduced confidence in code quality
- Cannot measure test coverage
- CI/CD pipeline cannot run meaningful tests

## Example Test Structure Needed
```typescript
// tests/unit/qrwc/client.test.ts
describe('QRWCClient', () => {
  describe('connect', () => {
    it('should establish WebSocket connection');
    it('should handle connection timeout');
    it('should emit connected event');
  });
  
  describe('retry logic', () => {
    it('should retry with exponential backoff');
    it('should respect max retry attempts');
  });
});
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- Minimum 80% code coverage for critical paths
- All public methods have at least one test
- Error scenarios are tested
- Mock WebSocket for unit tests
- Integration tests for end-to-end flows

## Priority
High - Tests are essential for maintaining code quality and enabling safe refactoring.
