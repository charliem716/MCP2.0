# BUG-135: Architecture - Missing Separation of Concerns (RESOLVED)

## Status: FIXED âœ…

## Summary
The MCP tools layer was tightly coupled to Q-SYS implementation, using `QRWCClientInterface` directly instead of dependency injection. This made the code hard to test and violated separation of concerns principles.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Created Control System Interface
- Added `src/mcp/interfaces/control-system.ts` with `IControlSystem` interface
- Provides abstraction for any control system (Q-SYS, Crestron, AMX, etc.)

### 2. Implemented Dependency Injection Container
- Added `src/mcp/infrastructure/container.ts` with simple DI container
- Supports service registration and factory functions
- Enables runtime configuration of dependencies

### 3. Updated All MCP Tools
- Changed from `QRWCClientInterface` to `IControlSystem` interface
- Updated constructors and factory functions across all tools
- Modified MCPToolRegistry to use the generic interface

### 4. Created Tests
- Added comprehensive tests in `tests/unit/mcp/architecture/separation-of-concerns.test.ts`
- Verifies dependency injection works correctly
- Demonstrates ability to swap implementations

## Benefits
1. **Testability**: Tools can now be tested with mock control systems
2. **Flexibility**: Easy to support other control systems (Crestron, AMX, etc.)
3. **Maintainability**: Clear boundaries between MCP protocol and control system
4. **Type Safety**: Still maintains full TypeScript type safety

## Files Modified
- `src/mcp/interfaces/control-system.ts` (new)
- `src/mcp/infrastructure/container.ts` (new)
- `src/mcp/tools/*.ts` (all tool files updated)
- `src/mcp/handlers/index.ts` (updated to use IControlSystem)
- `src/mcp/qrwc/adapter.ts` (updated interface)
- `tests/unit/mcp/architecture/separation-of-concerns.test.ts` (new)

## Verification
- All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
- ESLint warnings fixed
- Architecture test passes
- No regression in existing functionality
