**Last Updated**: 2025-01-28  
**Total Bugs**: 6 (BUG-131 through BUG-136)  
**Critical Bugs**: 2 (BUG-131, BUG-136)  
**High Priority**: 3 (BUG-132, BUG-133, BUG-135)  
**Medium Priority**: 1 (BUG-134)

## Resolution Order

### Phase 1: Unblock Development (Immediate)

#### 1. **BUG-131: TypeScript Compilation Error** ⚡ BLOCKER
- **Priority**: P0 (Emergency)
- **Effort**: Small (1-2 hours)
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Blocks**: Everything - cannot build without fixing this
- **Action**: Fix type definitions in event-cache manager immediately

### Phase 2: Foundation Fixes (Week 1)

#### 2. **BUG-133: Configuration Fragmentation**
- **Priority**: P1 (High)
- **Effort**: Medium (1-2 days)
- **Dependencies**: BUG-131 must be fixed first
- **Blocks**: Clean development environment
- **Why Now**: Fixing module system early prevents future import issues
- **Action**: Standardize on ESM, centralize configuration

#### 3. **BUG-134: Code Quality Issues**
- **Priority**: P2 (Medium)
- **Effort**: Small (4-6 hours)
- **Dependencies**: BUG-133 (clean imports help)
- **Blocks**: None directly, but affects code reliability
- **Why Now**: Quick wins that improve code quality immediately
- **Action**: Fix ESLint warnings one by one

### Phase 3: Architecture Refactoring (Week 2-3)

#### 4. **BUG-135: Architecture - Separation of Concerns**
- **Priority**: P1 (High)
- **Effort**: Large (1-2 weeks)
- **Dependencies**: BUG-133, BUG-134 (need clean base)
- **Blocks**: BUG-132 (need clean architecture first)
- **Why Now**: Fundamental architecture must be fixed before simplifying state
- **Action**: Implement dependency injection and interfaces

#### 5. **BUG-132: Complex State Management**
- **Priority**: P1 (High)
- **Effort**: Large (1-2 weeks)
- **Dependencies**: BUG-135 (need clean architecture)
- **Blocks**: Performance optimization
- **Why Now**: Can only simplify state after architecture is clean
- **Action**: Consolidate cache layers, flatten structure

### Phase 4: Production Readiness (Week 4)

#### 6. **BUG-136: Missing Production Features**
- **Priority**: P1 (High)
- **Effort**: Large (1-2 weeks)
- **Dependencies**: All previous bugs (need stable base)
- **Blocks**: Production deployment
- **Why Now**: Can only add production features to stable codebase
- **Action**: Add rate limiting, validation, monitoring, security

## Rationale for Order

### 1. **Build First** (BUG-131)
Cannot do anything if the code won't compile. This is the absolute blocker.

### 2. **Clean Foundation** (BUG-133, BUG-134)
- Module system consistency prevents future confusion
- Code quality fixes are quick wins that make everything easier
- Both create a stable base for larger refactoring

### 3. **Architecture Before Implementation** (BUG-135 before BUG-132)
- Must establish clean boundaries before simplifying state
- Dependency injection enables better testing for state refactor
- Architecture changes are more fundamental than implementation

### 4. **Production Last** (BUG-136)
- Adding production features to bad architecture wastes effort
- Clean, simple code is easier to secure and monitor
- Production features can be tested properly on refactored code

## Quick Wins vs Long-Term Fixes

### Quick Wins (Can do immediately):
- BUG-131: Type fix (1-2 hours)
- BUG-134: ESLint fixes (4-6 hours)
- Partial BUG-133: At least fix TypeScript config (2 hours)

### Medium-Term (Requires planning):
- BUG-133: Full module standardization
- BUG-135: Architecture refactoring (start with interfaces)

### Long-Term (Requires significant effort):
- BUG-132: State management simplification
- BUG-136: Full production readiness

## Parallel Work Opportunities

Some bugs can be worked on in parallel by different developers:

### Track 1 (Senior Developer):
- BUG-135 (Architecture)
- BUG-132 (State Management)

### Track 2 (Mid-Level Developer):
- BUG-133 (Configuration)
- BUG-134 (Code Quality)

### Track 3 (DevOps/SRE):
- BUG-136 (Production Features) - can start planning/designing early

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Create feature branches** for each major refactoring
2. **Maintain backwards compatibility** during architecture changes
3. **Write tests before refactoring** to ensure no regression
4. **Document changes** as you go
5. **Review after each phase** before proceeding

## Success Metrics

- **Phase 1**: Code compiles and passes tests
- **Phase 2**: Zero ESLint warnings, consistent module system
- **Phase 3**: All components unit testable, clear architecture docs
- **Phase 4**: Production readiness checklist complete

## Notes

- This order minimizes rework and technical debt
- Each phase builds on the previous one
- Early fixes make later fixes easier
- Production features added to clean code are more maintainable

Remember: **Fix it right the first time** - rushing will create more bugs.
