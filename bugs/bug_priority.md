 Critical Priority (P1) - Fix Immediately

  These bugs block all core functionality and must be fixed first:

  1. LIVE_TEST_BUG_SUMMARY - Response Format Issues

  - Impact: CRITICAL - All MCP tools return human-readable text instead of JSON
  - Code Quality: Breaks all tool parsing and AI agent integration
  - Fix Complexity: Low-Medium (format changes)
  - Note: Contains 5 high-priority bugs (BUG-042 through BUG-046)

  High Priority (P2) - Major Functionality Issues

  2. BUG-041: Missing Generic QRWC Send Tool

  - Impact: HIGH - Limits AI agent flexibility, prevents access to many Q-SYS commands
  - Code Quality: Blocks extensibility and testing capabilities
  - Fix Complexity: Low (single tool implementation)

  3. BUG-034: Change Group Methods Not Implemented

  - Impact: HIGH - Missing core Q-SYS efficiency features for control monitoring
  - Code Quality: Incomplete API implementation, affects performance
  - Fix Complexity: Medium-High (multiple method implementations)

  4. BUG-046: Excessive Disconnect Logging

  - Impact: MEDIUM-HIGH - Causes 200MB+ log spam, potential memory issues
  - Code Quality: System instability, debugging difficulties
  - Fix Complexity: Medium (state management and event cleanup)

  Medium Priority (P3) - API Completeness

  5. BUG-047: Create Q-SYS API Discovery Tool

  - Impact: MEDIUM - Improves AI agent usability and discoverability
  - Code Quality: Enhances developer experience and reduces trial-and-error
  - Fix Complexity: Medium (documentation parsing and structuring)

  6. BUG-039: Missing Component.Get MCP Tool

  - Impact: MEDIUM - Missing efficient component control access
  - Code Quality: Forces inefficient 2-step workflows
  - Fix Complexity: Low (single tool implementation)

  7. BUG-040: Missing Component.GetAllControls MCP Tool

  - Impact: MEDIUM - Missing system-wide control discovery
  - Code Quality: Forces multiple API calls for system monitoring
  - Fix Complexity: Low (single tool implementation)

  8. BUG-035: Parameter Format Incompatibility

  - Impact: MEDIUM - API compatibility issues with Q-SYS specification
  - Code Quality: Non-standard parameter handling
  - Fix Complexity: Medium (parameter parsing logic)

  Low Priority (P4) - Polish and Standards

  9. BUG-025: Hardcoded Configuration Values

  - Impact: LOW-MEDIUM - Deployment inflexibility
  - Code Quality: Reduces configurability and maintainability
  - Fix Complexity: Low-Medium (environment variable setup)

  10. BUG-036: Incomplete Component Response Format

  - Impact: LOW - Missing component properties in responses
  - Code Quality: Incomplete API specification compliance
  - Fix Complexity: Low-Medium (response format enhancement)

  11. BUG-023: Console.log in Production Code

  - Impact: LOW - Violates logging standards
  - Code Quality: Inconsistent logging, potential production issues
  - Fix Complexity: Low (replace console statements with logger)

  12. BUG-028: Missing Event Listener Cleanup

  - Impact: LOW - Memory leaks in specific scenarios
  - Code Quality: Resource management issue
  - Fix Complexity: Low (event handler cleanup)

  13. BUG-012: Premature Phase Creation

  - Impact: LOW - Project organization issue
  - Code Quality: Violates implementation methodology
  - Fix Complexity: Low (directory cleanup)

  Recommended Implementation Order:

  1. Start with LIVE_TEST_BUG_SUMMARY - Fix response formats first (blocks everything else)
  2. BUG-041 + BUG-046 - Add generic tool and fix logging (high impact, medium effort)
  3. BUG-034 - Implement Change Group methods (major functionality)
  4. BUG-039 + BUG-040 - Add missing component tools (quick wins)
  5. BUG-047 - API discovery tool (improves everything else)
  6. BUG-035 - Fix parameter compatibility
  7. Remaining bugs - Polish and standards compliance

  The top 4-5 bugs will have the most significant impact on system stability and functionality.
