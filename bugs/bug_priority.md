# Bug Priority List

Last Updated: 2025-01-20

## Critical Priority (P1) - Fix Immediately

These bugs block core functionality and must be fixed first:

### 1. BUG-034: Change Group Methods Not Implemented
- Impact: HIGH - Missing core Q-SYS efficiency features for control monitoring
- Code Quality: Incomplete API implementation, affects performance
- Fix Complexity: Medium-High (multiple method implementations)

### 2. BUG-044: Missing Integration Tests for Critical User Workflows
- Impact: HIGH - No end-to-end testing for essential workflows
- Code Quality: Integration issues only discovered in production
- Fix Complexity: High (integration test framework and scenarios)

## Medium Priority (P2) - Code Quality & Architecture

### 3. BUG-037: Missing Q-SYS Protocol Version Negotiation
- Impact: MEDIUM - No version negotiation with Q-SYS Core
- Code Quality: Risks compatibility issues with different versions
- Fix Complexity: Medium (protocol implementation)

### 4. BUG-038: Over-Engineered Synchronizer Implementation
- Impact: MEDIUM - Unnecessarily complex for simple polling task
- Code Quality: Violates YAGNI principle
- Fix Complexity: Low-Medium (simplification)

### 5. BUG-039: Overly Complex LRU Cache Implementation
- Impact: MEDIUM - Includes unused features (TTL, events, serialization)
- Code Quality: Adds unnecessary complexity
- Fix Complexity: Low-Medium (simplification)

### 6. BUG-040: Adapter.ts File Exceeds Maintainable Size Limits
- Impact: MEDIUM - 500+ lines handling multiple responsibilities
- Code Quality: Violates single responsibility principle
- Fix Complexity: Medium (modularization)

### 7. BUG-043: Inconsistent Error Handling Patterns Across Codebase
- Impact: MEDIUM - Multiple different error handling approaches
- Code Quality: Makes debugging difficult
- Fix Complexity: Medium (standardization)

### 8. BUG-025: Hardcoded Configuration Values
- Impact: MEDIUM - Deployment inflexibility
- Code Quality: Reduces configurability and maintainability
- Fix Complexity: Low-Medium (environment variable setup)

## Low Priority (P3) - Polish and Standards

### 9. BUG-042: Unnecessary Re-export Files Creating Circular Dependencies
- Impact: LOW - Multiple index.ts files only re-exporting
- Code Quality: Adds complexity and circular dependency risk
- Fix Complexity: Low (cleanup and direct imports)

### 10. BUG-023: Console.log in Production Code
- Impact: LOW - Violates logging standards
- Code Quality: Inconsistent logging, potential production issues
- Fix Complexity: Low (replace console statements with logger)
