# BUG-094: Compression Tests Failing

**Status**: Open  
**Severity**: High  
**Priority**: P1 (High)  
**Component**: Event Cache - Compression  
**Reported Date**: 2025-01-24  
**Reporter**: Audit System  
**Assignee**: Unassigned  

## Summary
5 out of 6 compression tests are failing, indicating issues with the compression implementation or test setup.

## Description
The compression feature tests are failing with the following issues:
- Recent window compression not working as expected
- Medium window significance-based compression failing
- Compression statistics not tracked properly
- Event type preservation not working
- Memory pressure compression triggers failing

Only the "ancient window state transitions" test is passing.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Run `npm test -- --testPathPattern=compression.test.ts`
2. Observe 5 test failures out of 6 tests
3. Check specific assertion failures

## Expected Behavior
- Events in recent window (< 1 min) should not be compressed
- Medium window should keep only significant changes (>5% delta)
- Ancient window should keep only state transitions
- Statistics should track compression ratios
- Memory pressure should trigger aggressive compression

## Actual Behavior
Most compression logic appears to not be executing or is executing incorrectly.

## Environment
- **Test Framework**: Jest
- **Component**: Event Cache Compression

## Error Logs/Stack Trace
```
● EventCacheManager Compression › Compression thresholds › should keep all events in recent window
    expect(received).toBe(expected) // Object.is equality
    
● EventCacheManager Compression › Compression thresholds › should compress events in medium window based on significance
    Timeout after 2462ms
```

## Root Cause Analysis
Potential issues:
1. Compression timer not firing in tests
2. Time window calculations incorrect
3. Mock time not properly configured
4. Compression logic has bugs

## Proposed Solution
```typescript
// Ensure compression runs in tests
beforeEach(() => {
  jest.useFakeTimers();
});

afterEach(() => {
  jest.useRealTimers();
});

// Trigger compression manually in tests
it('should compress events', async () => {
  // Add events
  // Advance time
  jest.advanceTimersByTime(60000);
  // Manually trigger compression
  await manager.runCompression();
  // Assert compression occurred
});
```

## Test Cases
- [ ] Fix timer issues in tests
- [ ] Verify compression thresholds
- [ ] Test significance calculations
- [ ] Validate statistics tracking

## Related Issues
- Related to: BUG-090 (general test failures)
- Part of: Step 2.2 implementation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All compression tests pass
- [ ] Compression behavior matches specification
- [ ] Statistics accurately tracked
- [ ] No timing issues in tests
