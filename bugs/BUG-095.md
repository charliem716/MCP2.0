# BUG-095: Test Coverage Cannot Be Measured

**Status**: Open  
**Severity**: Low  
**Priority**: P3 (Low)  
**Component**: Event Cache - Testing  
**Reported Date**: 2025-01-24  
**Reporter**: Audit System  
**Assignee**: Unassigned  

## Summary
Test coverage percentage cannot be accurately measured due to failing tests, preventing assessment of Step 2.2's test completeness.

## Description
The requirement states that test coverage should not drop compared to the main branch. However, with multiple test failures in:
- Disk spillover tests (6 failures)
- Compression tests (5 failures)  
- Memory management tests (2 timeouts)

We cannot accurately measure the coverage impact of Step 2.2 implementation.

## Impact
- Cannot verify if coverage requirement is met
- Potential untested code paths
- Risk of regression bugs
- CI/CD pipeline may be affected

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Run `npm test -- --coverage --testPathPattern=event-cache`
2. Observe test failures prevent accurate coverage calculation
3. Coverage report shows incomplete data

## Expected Behavior
- All tests should pass
- Coverage report should show accurate percentages
- Coverage should not decrease from baseline

## Actual Behavior
- Test failures prevent coverage measurement
- Unable to compare with main branch baseline

## Root Cause Analysis
- **Cause**: Dependent on BUG-090, BUG-094 test failures
- **Blocker**: Must fix failing tests first

## Proposed Solution
1. Fix all failing tests (BUG-090, BUG-094)
2. Run coverage report on main branch for baseline
3. Run coverage on feature branch
4. Compare and ensure no regression

```bash
# After fixing tests
npm test -- --coverage > coverage-feature.txt
git checkout main
npm test -- --coverage > coverage-main.txt
# Compare coverage percentages
```

## Test Cases
- [ ] All event cache tests pass
- [ ] Coverage report generates successfully
- [ ] Coverage meets or exceeds baseline
- [ ] No untested new code

## Related Issues
- Blocked by: BUG-090, BUG-094
- Part of: Step 2.2 verification

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Coverage measurable after test fixes
- [ ] Coverage >= main branch baseline
- [ ] All new code has test coverage
- [ ] Coverage report in CI/CD
