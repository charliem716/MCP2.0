# BUG-037: Missing Q-SYS Protocol Version Negotiation

**Status**: Open  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Priority**: P2 (Medium)  
**Component**: QRWC Adapter / Q-SYS Integration  
**Reported Date**: 2025-01-20  
**Reporter**: Phase-2 Audit  
**Assignee**: Unassigned  

## Summary
The QRWC adapter lacks protocol version negotiation, risking compatibility issues with different Q-SYS Core versions.

## Description
The current implementation assumes a fixed protocol version without negotiating capabilities with the Q-SYS Core. This can lead to:
- Incompatibility with older/newer Q-SYS Core versions
- Silent failures when protocol features change
- Inability to gracefully degrade functionality
- No warning when connecting to unsupported versions

The Q-SYS WebSocket protocol supports version negotiation to ensure compatibility between clients and cores.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Connect to Q-SYS Core with different firmware versions
2. Attempt to use features that may vary by version
3. Expected result: Version negotiation ensures compatibility
4. Actual result: Fixed protocol assumptions may fail silently

## Expected Behavior
The adapter should:
1. Query the Q-SYS Core for supported protocol versions
2. Negotiate the highest mutually supported version
3. Adjust feature availability based on negotiated version
4. Warn or fail gracefully for incompatible versions

## Actual Behavior
No version negotiation occurs; the adapter assumes all cores support the same protocol version.

## Environment
- **OS**: All
- **Node.js Version**: v20.x
- **Project Version/Commit**: bug/001-fix branch
- **Q-SYS Core Version**: Various (8.x, 9.x, 10.x)

## Root Cause Analysis
- **File(s)**: `src/mcp/qrwc/adapter.ts`
- **Line(s)**: Connection initialization logic
- **Cause**: Implementation doesn't include version negotiation phase

## Proposed Solution
```typescript
// Add version negotiation during connection
interface ProtocolVersion {
  major: number;
  minor: number;
  features: string[];
}

class QRWCAdapter {
  private negotiatedVersion?: ProtocolVersion;
  
  async connect() {
    // After WebSocket connection
    const supportedVersions = await this.querySupportedVersions();
    this.negotiatedVersion = this.negotiateVersion(supportedVersions);
    
    if (!this.negotiatedVersion) {
      throw new Error('No compatible protocol version found');
    }
    
    // Adjust capabilities based on version
    this.configureCapabilities(this.negotiatedVersion);
  }
}
```

## Test Cases
- [ ] Test connection to Q-SYS Core v8.x
- [ ] Test connection to Q-SYS Core v9.x
- [ ] Test connection to Q-SYS Core v10.x
- [ ] Test graceful degradation of features
- [ ] Test incompatible version handling

## Related Issues
- Related to: Q-SYS compatibility and reliability

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Version negotiation implemented
- [ ] Compatible with Q-SYS Core versions 8.x-10.x
- [ ] Clear error messages for incompatible versions
- [ ] Feature availability adjusted based on version
