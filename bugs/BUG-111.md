# BUG-111: ESLint warnings need systematic cleanup

## Description
The codebase has 565 ESLint warnings (0 errors) that should be addressed for better code quality and maintainability. While these don't block functionality, they indicate potential type safety issues and code smell.

## Current Behavior
- 565 ESLint warnings when running `npm run lint`
- Most common warning types:
  - Unsafe member access on `any` values
  - Unsafe assignment of `any` values
  - Duplicate imports
  - Unnecessary conditionals
  - Prefer nullish coalescing operators
  - Complexity warnings (functions exceeding max statements/complexity)

## Expected Behavior
- Ideally 0 warnings, or at most <50 warnings for legitimate edge cases
- All `any` types should be properly typed
- Code should follow ESLint best practices

## Impact
- **Severity**: Low
- **Priority**: P3
- No functional impact, but affects:
  - Code maintainability
  - Type safety confidence
  - Developer experience
  - Potential for hidden bugs

## Root Cause
- Legacy code patterns from rapid development
- Incomplete type definitions in some areas
- Complex functions that need refactoring
- Overly permissive `any` usage

## Proposed Solution
1. Run `npm run lint:fix` to auto-fix simple issues
2. Address `any` type usage systematically:
   - Add proper type definitions
   - Use type guards where needed
   - Add explicit type assertions with validation
3. Refactor complex functions exceeding statement/complexity limits
4. Update import statements to avoid duplicates
5. Use nullish coalescing (`??`) instead of logical OR (`||`) where appropriate

## Files Most Affected
- `src/mcp/qrwc/adapter.ts`
- `src/mcp/qrwc/command-handlers.ts`
- `src/mcp/state/simple-synchronizer.ts`
- `src/mcp/tools/*.ts`
- `src/shared/utils/errorHandler.ts`

## Reproduction Steps
1. Run `npm run lint`
2. Observe 565 warnings output

## Test Scenario
After fixes:
1. Run `npm run lint` - should show significantly fewer warnings
2. Run `npm test` - all tests should still pass
3. Run `npm run type-check` - should still pass
4. Run `npm run build` - should still compile successfully

## Notes
- This is a code quality issue, not a functional bug
- Should be addressed incrementally to avoid introducing regressions
- Consider adding ESLint rules to prevent new warnings from being introduced
