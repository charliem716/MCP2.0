# BUG-139: High Cognitive Complexity in Core Components

**Status**: Open
**Severity**: Medium
**Priority**: P2 (Medium)
**Component**: Code Quality, Core Architecture
**Reported Date**: 2025-07-29
**Reporter**: Gemini
**Assignee**: Unassigned

## Summary

Several core components of the application have functions and methods with high cognitive complexity, meaning they do too many things. This makes the code hard to read, understand, maintain, and test.

## Description

ESLint has identified a constructor in `EventCacheManager` with 27 statements, which exceeds the configured limit of 25. This is a symptom of a broader issue in the codebase: large, monolithic functions that handle multiple responsibilities. This leads to:

- **Difficult Maintenance:** When a bug needs to be fixed or a feature needs to be added, developers have to understand the entire complex function, increasing the risk of introducing new bugs.
- **Poor Readability:** It is difficult to quickly understand what a function does when it has many lines of code and multiple levels of nesting.
- **Limited Reusability:** A large function that does many things is less likely to be reusable in other parts of the application.
- **Incomplete Test Coverage:** It is very difficult to write unit tests that cover all the possible execution paths of a complex function.

## Steps to Reproduce

1.  Run `npm run lint` and observe the `max-statements` warning for the constructor of `EventCacheManager`.
2.  Manually inspect other core components, such as `QRWCClientAdapter` and `MCPServer`, for methods that are longer than 25-30 lines or have multiple levels of `if/else` nesting.

## Expected Behavior

- Functions and methods should adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), doing one thing and doing it well.
- No single function or method should exceed a reasonable complexity limit (e.g., 25 statements).
- The codebase should be composed of small, focused, and easily testable functions.

## Actual Behavior

The codebase contains several large, complex functions that are difficult to manage.

## Proposed Solution

Systematically refactor complex functions and methods into smaller, single-responsibility functions.

**Example Refactoring of the `EventCacheManager` Constructor:**

**Before:**
```typescript
// src/mcp/state/event-cache/manager.ts
constructor(config: CacheConfig) {
  // 27 lines of initialization logic...
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
// src/mcp/state/event-cache/manager.ts
constructor(config: CacheConfig) {
  this.config = config;
  this.initializeBuffers();
  this.setupEventListeners();
  this.startMonitoring();
}

private initializeBuffers(): void {
  // Logic for setting up the cache buffers
}

private setupEventListeners(): void {
  // Logic for attaching to adapter events
}

private startMonitoring(): void {
  // Logic for starting the memory monitoring interval
}
```

This approach should be applied to any function or method that exceeds the complexity threshold.

## Test Cases

- [ ] The constructor of `EventCacheManager` is refactored into smaller private methods, and the `max-statements` lint warning is resolved.
- [ ] At least 5 other complex functions in the codebase are identified and refactored.
- [ ] Unit test coverage is increased for the refactored components to ensure no regressions.

## Related Issues

- **Related to:** BUG-134

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The `max-statements` ESLint warning is resolved.
- [ ] All refactored functions have corresponding unit tests.
- [ ] The cognitive complexity of the codebase, as measured by tools like SonarQube or CodeClimate (if available), is reduced.
