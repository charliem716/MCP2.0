# BUG-093: LOC Constraint Violation - Step 2.2 Implementation

**Status**: Open  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Priority**: P2 (Medium)  
**Component**: Event Cache - Implementation Size  
**Reported Date**: 2025-01-24  
**Reporter**: Audit System  
**Assignee**: Unassigned  

## Summary
Step 2.2 implementation exceeds the 200 LOC constraint by 2500 lines, indicating potential over-engineering or scope creep.

## Description
The Step 2.2 implementation added 2699 net lines of code, far exceeding the 200 LOC constraint mentioned in requirements. This massive expansion includes:
- Extensive compression logic in manager.ts
- New test files for compression and disk spillover
- Additional type definitions and helpers

While the functionality is complete, the size suggests the implementation may be overly complex or could be refactored for simplicity.

## Evidence
```
git diff --stat $(git merge-base main HEAD)
Total: 3303 insertions(+), 604 deletions(-)
Net: +2699 LOC
```

## Impact
- Increased maintenance burden
- Higher complexity for future developers
- Potential performance implications
- More surface area for bugs

## Root Cause Analysis
- **File(s)**: `src/mcp/state/event-cache/manager.ts`
- **Cause**: 
  1. Inline implementation of all features instead of modular approach
  2. Extensive error handling and edge cases
  3. Complex compression algorithms
  4. Detailed logging and statistics

## Proposed Solution
Consider refactoring into separate modules:
```typescript
// event-cache/compression.ts
export class CompressionEngine {
  // Move compression logic here
}

// event-cache/disk-spillover.ts  
export class DiskSpilloverManager {
  // Move disk operations here
}

// event-cache/statistics.ts
export class EventStatistics {
  // Move stats tracking here
}
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Document why constraint was exceeded
- [ ] Consider refactoring opportunities
- [ ] Update constraints for future steps
- [ ] Review with team for lessons learned
