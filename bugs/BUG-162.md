# BUG-162: Implement Connection Resilience and Retry Logic

**Status**: Open  
**Severity**: High  
**Priority**: P1 (High)  
**Component**: mcp/qrwc, connection management  
**Reported Date**: 2025-08-07  
**Reporter**: Assistant  
**Assignee**: Unassigned

## Summary

Q-SYS connection lacks proper retry logic and resilience, causing failures when network issues occur.

## Description

Current implementation has basic connection but lacks:
- Exponential backoff for reconnection
- Circuit breaker pattern
- Connection health monitoring
- Graceful degradation
- Automatic recovery

This causes production instability when:
- Network interruptions occur
- Q-SYS Core restarts
- Temporary connection issues
- High latency situations

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Start MCP server connected to Q-SYS
2. Disconnect network or restart Q-SYS Core
3. Observe connection not recovering properly
4. Manual restart required

## Expected Behavior

- Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- Maximum retry limits
- Health status reporting
- Graceful degradation during outages
- Automatic recovery when connection restored

## Actual Behavior

- Connection fails and doesn't recover
- No retry mechanism
- System becomes unresponsive
- Manual intervention required

## Environment

- **OS**: All
- **Node.js Version**: v20+
- **Q-SYS Core**: Any version
- **Network**: Variable conditions

## Error Logs/Stack Trace

```
Error: Connection timeout
Error: WebSocket closed unexpectedly
Error: ECONNREFUSED
```

## Root Cause Analysis

- OfficialQRWCClient has basic reconnection but not robust
- No exponential backoff implementation
- No circuit breaker to prevent cascade failures
- Missing connection health monitoring

## Proposed Solution

```typescript
class ConnectionManager {
  private retryCount = 0;
  private maxRetries = 10;
  private circuitBreaker = new CircuitBreaker();
  
  async connectWithRetry(): Promise<void> {
    if (this.circuitBreaker.isOpen()) {
      throw new Error('Circuit breaker open');
    }
    
    try {
      await this.connect();
      this.retryCount = 0;
      this.circuitBreaker.onSuccess();
    } catch (error) {
      this.circuitBreaker.onFailure();
      
      if (this.retryCount < this.maxRetries) {
        const delay = Math.min(1000 * Math.pow(2, this.retryCount), 30000);
        await sleep(delay);
        this.retryCount++;
        return this.connectWithRetry();
      }
      throw new Error('Max retries exceeded');
    }
  }
}
```

## Workaround

Restart MCP server when connection issues occur

## Test Cases

- [ ] Connection recovers from network interruption
- [ ] Exponential backoff working correctly
- [ ] Circuit breaker prevents cascade failures
- [ ] Health endpoint reports connection status
- [ ] Graceful degradation during outage
- [ ] Recovery after extended downtime

## Related Issues

- Related to: BUG-163 (Error Boundaries)
- Blocks: Production stability

## Additional Context

- Critical for production reliability
- Prevents 3am wake-up calls
- Improves user experience
- Required for SLA compliance

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Automatic reconnection working
- [ ] Exponential backoff implemented
- [ ] Circuit breaker pattern active
- [ ] Connection health monitoring
- [ ] Zero manual interventions needed
- [ ] Recovery time < 5 minutes

## Notes

High priority for production stability
