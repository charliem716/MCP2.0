# BUG-165: Clean Up File Structure and Remove Obsolete Code

**Status**: Open  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Priority**: P2 (Medium)  
**Component**: repository, file-structure  
**Reported Date**: 2025-08-07  
**Reporter**: Assistant  
**Assignee**: Unassigned

## Summary

Repository has 45+ test files scattered in root, obsolete code, and poor organization affecting maintainability.

## Description

Current issues:
- 45 test script files (.mjs) scattered throughout
- 15 files in root directory that should be organized
- Obsolete test files from debugging
- No clear directory structure
- Missing documentation organization
- Console.log statements in production code

This affects:
- Code maintainability
- Developer onboarding
- Repository professionalism
- Build size

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Run `ls *.mjs | wc -l` - shows many test files
2. Check root directory - cluttered with documentation
3. Search for console.log in src/
4. Look for obsolete test files

## Expected Behavior

```
/
├── src/              # Source code only
├── tests/            # All test files
├── docs/             # All documentation
├── scripts/          # Utility scripts
├── archive/          # Old files for reference
├── dist/             # Build output
└── [config files]    # Only essential configs in root
```

## Actual Behavior

- Test files scattered everywhere
- Documentation files in root
- Obsolete code not removed
- No consistent organization

## Environment

- **OS**: All
- **Project Structure**: Current repository

## Error Logs/Stack Trace

```bash
$ find . -name "*.mjs" | wc -l
45

$ ls *.md | wc -l
15
```

## Root Cause Analysis

- No established file organization standards
- Test files created during debugging not cleaned
- Documentation added to root by default
- No cleanup process after bug fixes

## Proposed Solution

```bash
# Create proper structure
mkdir -p archive/test-scripts
mkdir -p docs/guides
mkdir -p docs/api
mkdir -p scripts/maintenance

# Move files
mv test-*.mjs archive/test-scripts/
mv *.md docs/guides/  # except README.md
mv CLEANUP_PLAN.md EVENT-MONITORING-*.md docs/archive/

# Clean obsolete
find . -name "*.mjs" -mtime +30 -delete
grep -r "console.log" src/ | # Review and remove

# Keep in root only:
# - README.md
# - package.json, package-lock.json
# - tsconfig.json, jest.config.js
# - .env.example
# - .gitignore, .eslintrc
```

## Workaround

None - needs proper cleanup

## Test Cases

- [ ] No .mjs files in root
- [ ] Documentation organized in docs/
- [ ] No console.log in production code
- [ ] Clear directory structure
- [ ] Build size reduced
- [ ] All tests still run

## Related Issues

- Related to: Documentation tasks
- Improves: Developer experience

## Additional Context

- Improves repository professionalism
- Makes onboarding easier
- Reduces confusion
- Smaller build artifacts

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Root directory clean (only config files)
- [ ] All tests in tests/ directory
- [ ] Documentation in docs/
- [ ] No console.log statements
- [ ] Archive created for old files
- [ ] README updated with structure

## Notes

Medium priority - not blocking but improves quality
