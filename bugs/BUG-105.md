# BUG-105: Multiple Test Suite Failures During STEP-1.2 Verification

**Status**: Open  
**Severity**: High  
**Priority**: P1 (High)  
**Component**: Testing / Event Cache  
**Reported Date**: 2025-07-24  
**Reporter**: STEP-1.2 Audit  
**Assignee**: Unassigned

## Summary

Multiple test suites fail during `npm run test:coverage`, preventing verification of STEP-1.2
implementation and accurate coverage measurement.

## Description

Test execution reveals failures in multiple test suites including:

- Event cache manager tests
- Tool registry tests
- Type safety regression tests
- Various integration tests

The failures prevent proper verification of the STEP-1.2 integration test implementation and make it
impossible to get accurate coverage metrics.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Run `npm run test:coverage`
2. Observe multiple test suite failures
3. Coverage report shows incomplete results

## Expected Behavior

All tests should pass, allowing accurate coverage measurement.

## Actual Behavior

Multiple test suites fail with various errors:

- Type errors in event cache tests
- Missing file errors in regression tests
- Tool registry initialization issues
- Integration test failures

## Environment

- **OS**: macOS Darwin 24.5.0
- **Node.js Version**: Unknown
- **Project Version/Commit**: feature/step-1-2-add-integration-test branch

## Error Logs/Stack Trace

```
FAIL tests/archived/bug-regression/bug-054-type-safety.test.ts
FAIL tests/unit/mcp/handlers/registry.test.ts
... (additional failed suites)
```

## Root Cause Analysis

- **File(s)**: Multiple test files
- **Cause**:
  - Type mismatches between tests and implementation
  - Missing expected files
  - Changed interfaces not reflected in tests
  - Tool count expectations outdated

## Proposed Solution

1. Fix TypeScript errors (see BUG-102)
2. Update test expectations to match current implementation
3. Remove or update tests for missing files
4. Ensure all test fixtures are properly set up

## Test Cases

- [ ] All test suites pass
- [ ] Coverage metrics accurately calculated
- [ ] No false positive failures
- [ ] Integration tests verify STEP-1.2 requirements

## Related Issues

- Blocked by: BUG-102 (TypeScript errors)
- Blocks: Accurate coverage measurement
- Related to: STEP-1.2 completion

## Additional Context

Current coverage shows 64.73% line coverage, but this may be inaccurate due to test failures.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `npm test` passes all suites
- [ ] Coverage report shows accurate metrics
- [ ] STEP-1.2 integration tests run successfully
- [ ] No test failures due to environment issues
