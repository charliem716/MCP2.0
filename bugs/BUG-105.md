# BUG-105: read_change_group_events Tool Missing Timeout Protection

## Summary
The `read_change_group_events` tool lacks timeout protection for long-running queries, which could cause the tool to hang indefinitely on large datasets.

## Severity
Medium

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Create a large event cache with 100k+ events
2. Execute a complex query without time bounds
3. Observe that the query can run indefinitely without timeout

## Expected Behavior
- Queries should have a configurable timeout (e.g., 30 seconds)
- Long-running queries should be cancelled with appropriate error message
- Timeout should be configurable via tool parameters or system config

## Actual Behavior
- No timeout protection implemented
- Queries can run indefinitely
- No way to cancel long-running queries

## Root Cause
The EventCacheManager.query() method is called without any timeout wrapper or cancellation mechanism.

## Proposed Solution
1. Add timeout parameter to tool schema (optional, default 30s)
2. Implement query execution with Promise.race() and timeout
3. Return appropriate error message on timeout
4. Consider adding query complexity estimation

## Code Location
- `/src/mcp/tools/change-groups.ts:551` - query execution without timeout
- `/src/mcp/state/event-cache/manager.ts` - may need timeout support in query method
