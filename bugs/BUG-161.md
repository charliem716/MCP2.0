# BUG-161: Security Vulnerabilities and Dependency Updates

**Status**: Open  
**Severity**: Critical  
**Priority**: P0 (Emergency)  
**Component**: dependencies, security  
**Reported Date**: 2025-08-07  
**Reporter**: Assistant  
**Assignee**: Unassigned

## Summary

Security audit required to identify and fix vulnerabilities in dependencies before production deployment.

## Description

Production deployment requires:
- Zero critical or high severity vulnerabilities
- All dependencies up to date
- Security best practices implemented
- Environment variable validation
- Rate limiting on MCP tools

Current status unknown - full audit needed.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Run `npm audit`
2. Run `npm outdated`
3. Check for deprecated packages
4. Review environment variable handling
5. Check for hardcoded secrets

## Expected Behavior

- `npm audit` shows 0 vulnerabilities
- All production dependencies current
- Environment variables validated
- No secrets in code
- Rate limiting implemented

## Actual Behavior

- Audit status unknown
- Some dependencies may be outdated
- No environment variable validation
- No rate limiting on MCP tools

## Environment

- **OS**: All
- **Node.js Version**: v20+
- **npm Version**: 10+
- **Project Version/Commit**: Current main branch

## Error Logs/Stack Trace

```bash
# To be populated after running:
npm audit
npm outdated
```

## Root Cause Analysis

- Dependencies not regularly updated
- No automated security scanning
- Missing input validation layer
- No rate limiting middleware

## Proposed Solution

1. Run `npm audit fix` for automatic fixes
2. Manually update breaking changes
3. Add environment variable validation schema
4. Implement rate limiting middleware
5. Add secrets management
6. Create security policy document

## Workaround

None - security issues must be properly fixed

## Test Cases

- [ ] `npm audit` returns 0 vulnerabilities
- [ ] All dependencies less than 6 months old
- [ ] Invalid environment variables cause startup failure
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents abuse
- [ ] No secrets in git history

## Related Issues

- Blocks: Production deployment
- Related to: BUG-162 (Error Handling)

## Additional Context

- Critical for production deployment
- May require major version updates
- Could break existing functionality
- Needs thorough testing after updates

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Zero HIGH or CRITICAL vulnerabilities
- [ ] All production dependencies current
- [ ] Environment validation implemented
- [ ] Rate limiting active
- [ ] Security documentation complete
- [ ] `.env.example` file created

## Notes

Must be completed immediately after test fixes for production safety
