# BUG-107: Test Coverage Below Required Thresholds

## Summary
While all tests are now passing (741 tests across 64 test suites), the test coverage is below the required 80% threshold across all metrics.

## Severity
Medium (downgraded from Critical - tests are passing but coverage needs improvement)

## Current Status (as of 2025-01-26)
- **Test Suites**: 64 passed, 0 failed (100% pass rate) ✅
- **Individual Tests**: 710 passed, 31 skipped, 0 failed (100% pass rate) ✅
- **Coverage**: Below 80% threshold ❌
  - Statements: 73.37% (target: 80%)
  - Branches: 65.3% (target: 80%)
  - Lines: 73.96% (target: 80%)
  - Functions: 72.89% (target: 80%)

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Run `npm run test:coverage`
2. Observe coverage report falls below 80% threshold

## Expected Behavior
- All tests should pass ✅ (FIXED)
- Test coverage should be above 80% ❌
- No import/module errors ✅ (FIXED)

## Actual Behavior
- All tests passing (previously 78% failure rate - FIXED)
- Coverage at ~73% (below 80% standard)
- One remaining import.meta usage in src/mcp/index.ts:60 (not causing test failures)
  - Used only for main module detection: `if (import.meta.url === \`file://\${process.argv[1]}\`)`
  - Does not affect test execution

## Root Cause (Updated)
Original issues have been resolved:
1. ~~Jest configuration using deprecated `ts-jest` globals~~ ✅ FIXED
2. ~~Module system conflicts (ESM vs CommonJS)~~ ✅ FIXED
3. ~~Import.meta usage in non-ESM context~~ ✅ Mostly fixed (1 instance remains but not breaking)
4. ~~Mock function expectation failures~~ ✅ FIXED
5. ~~Assertion failures in tool descriptions~~ ✅ FIXED

Current issue:
- Insufficient test coverage in key areas

## Areas Needing Coverage
Based on coverage report:
1. **src/qrwc/officialClient.ts** - 40.67% coverage (needs significant work)
2. **src/mcp/tools/components.ts** - 60.6% coverage
3. **src/mcp/tools/status.ts** - 71.09% coverage
4. **src/mcp/tools/controls.ts** - 75.61% coverage
5. **src/shared/utils/env.ts** - 43.75% coverage
6. **src/shared/utils/error-recovery.ts** - 34.37% coverage

## Proposed Solution
1. Add unit tests for untested methods in officialClient.ts
2. Increase coverage for MCP tools (components, status, controls)
3. Add tests for error recovery utilities
4. Test environment configuration edge cases
5. Cover error paths and edge cases in existing tests

## Recent Fixes Applied
- Fixed all failing test suites (from 61 failures to 0)
- Fixed all individual test failures (from 1251 failures to 0)
- Resolved ESM/CommonJS conflicts
- Fixed mock expectations and assertions
- Updated tests to expect JSON responses instead of formatted strings

## Related Issues
- ~~Blocks verification of STEP-3.1 implementation~~ ✅ No longer blocking
- Prevents achieving required 80% coverage threshold
- May hide untested edge cases and error conditions
