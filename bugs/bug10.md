# BUG-010: Premature Creation of Phase 2-4 Components

## Status
ðŸ”´ **OPEN**

## Priority
Low

## Component
Project Structure

## Description
Components for Phase 2, 3, and 4 have been created before Phase 1 is complete, violating the phased implementation approach outlined in the implementation plan.

## Existing Components (Should Not Exist Yet)

### Phase 2 Components (MCP Server)
- `src/mcp/handlers/`
- `src/mcp/qrwc/`

### Phase 3 Components (OpenAI Agent)
- `src/agent/conversation/`
- `src/agent/tools/`
- `src/agent/voice/`

### Phase 4 Components (REST API & Web UI)
- `src/api/middleware/`
- `src/api/routes/`
- `src/api/websocket/`
- `src/web/`

## Evidence
From implementation.md:
- **Phase 1**: Foundation (Week 1) - Core Infrastructure, QRWC Client
- **Phase 2**: MCP Server (Week 1) - MCP Protocol, Q-SYS Tools
- **Phase 3**: OpenAI Agent Integration (Week 2) - Agent Setup, Voice Integration
- **Phase 4**: REST API & Web UI (Week 2) - API Server, Web Components

## Impact
- Potential confusion about project status
- Risk of building on incomplete foundations
- May contain unfinished or placeholder code
- Makes it harder to track actual progress
- Could lead to integration issues if Phase 1 changes

## Questions to Address
1. Do these directories contain actual implementation or just placeholders?
2. Were they created as part of initial project scaffolding?
3. Should they be removed until their respective phases?

## Recommended Solution

### Option 1: Remove Premature Components
```bash
# Remove Phase 2-4 components
rm -rf src/mcp src/agent src/api src/web
```

### Option 2: Keep as Scaffolding
If these are intentional scaffolding:
1. Add README.md to each directory explaining it's for future phases
2. Ensure no actual implementation exists yet
3. Add .gitkeep files to maintain directory structure

### Option 3: Document Current State
If implementation has already begun:
1. Document what's been implemented
2. Assess if it should be completed or removed
3. Update project timeline accordingly

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Clear decision made on handling premature components
- [ ] Project structure matches current phase (Phase 1)
- [ ] No confusion about what's implemented vs. planned
- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect actual state
- [ ] Git history shows clear phase boundaries
