# BUG-207: Position/Level Control Detection Failure

## Bug Summary
Test 12.1 (Simple Get Operations) failed because the system only found 1 position/level control instead of the required 2. The root cause was that the `inferControlType` function in `controls.ts` didn't recognize position-related control patterns like "stepper", "fader", "slider", etc.

## Test Failure Details
- **Test**: Test 12.1 - Simple Get Operations
- **Expected**: At least 2 position/level controls found
- **Actual**: Only 1 position/level control found (`Main Input Gain.stepper.value`)
- **Result**: FAIL

## Root Cause Analysis
The `inferControlType` private method in `src/mcp/tools/controls.ts` was only checking for:
- "gain" or "level" patterns → categorized as 'gain'
- "mute" patterns → categorized as 'mute'
- Input/output select patterns → categorized appropriately

It was missing detection for position-related controls:
- "stepper" controls (like `stepper.value`)
- "position" controls
- "fader" controls
- "slider" controls
- Controls with 0-1 range that represent positions

## Fix Implementation

### Changed File: `src/mcp/tools/controls.ts`

Modified the `inferControlType` method (lines 332-381) to:

1. **Add position control pattern detection** (lines 339-343):
   - Check for "position", "stepper", "fader", "slider" keywords
   - Return 'position' type for these controls

2. **Refine gain/level detection** (lines 346-348):
   - Exclude controls that contain "position" from being marked as 'gain'
   - Ensure level controls with dB are still properly identified as 'gain'

3. **Add value range heuristic** (lines 367-371):
   - Float controls with ValueMin=0 and ValueMax=1 are likely position controls
   - This catches controls without obvious naming patterns

4. **Improve String field handling** (lines 374-377):
   - Added type checking to prevent runtime errors with undefined String field

## Testing
Created comprehensive unit tests in `tests/unit/mcp/tools/position-control-detection.test.ts` to verify:
- Stepper controls are identified as 'position' type
- Position controls are properly categorized
- Fader and slider controls are marked as 'position'
- 0-1 range Float controls default to 'position' when no name hints exist
- Level controls with dB are still correctly identified as 'gain'

## Impact
- **Severity**: Medium - Test functionality affected, control categorization improved
- **Scope**: Limited to control type inference in list_controls tool
- **Risk**: Low - Only affects control categorization, not control functionality

## Verification
After the fix:
- Position/stepper/fader/slider controls are now properly categorized as 'position' type
- Test 12.1 should now find 2+ position/level controls as required
- Control discovery and filtering by type works more accurately

## Prevention
- Expand test coverage for different control naming patterns
- Document expected control type categorization rules
- Consider making control type detection configurable or extensible
