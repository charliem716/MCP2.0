# BUG-210: Test 3.3 Maximum Batch Size Limits Not Executed

## Summary
Test 3.3 from the master test prompts (Maximum Batch Size Limits) failed to execute. The test requires enumerating all controls and testing batch operations with 100 GET and 95 SET operations, but these steps were not performed.

## Status
**Status:** OPEN  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Component:** Testing/MCP Tools  
**Introduced:** Unknown  
**Fixed:** Pending  

## Description
The Maximum Batch Size Limits test (Test 3.3) requires:
1. Finding ALL available controls in the system
2. Building a list of exactly 100 real control names
3. Testing GET with 100 controls
4. Testing SET with 95 controls
5. Determining maximum working batch sizes

The test execution failed because these specific steps were not performed. The agent needs explicit, detailed instructions to complete all steps.

## Root Cause
The original test prompt lacks sufficient detail to ensure complete execution. The agent needs:
- Explicit instructions to enumerate ALL components first
- Clear directive to collect controls from each component
- Specific formatting for collecting 100+ controls
- Timing instrumentation requirements
- Error handling for batch size limits

## Solution

### Enhanced Test Prompt for Test 3.3

```
TEST: Maximum Batch Size Limits - COMPLETE EXECUTION REQUIRED

This test MUST be executed in full. Follow these steps EXACTLY:

PHASE 1: Control Enumeration (REQUIRED)
1. First, use list_components to get ALL components
2. For EACH component returned, use list_controls with that component name
3. Collect ALL control names in format: "ComponentName.controlName"
4. Continue until you have collected at least 100 unique control names
5. Report the EXACT total number of controls found

PHASE 2: Prepare Test Data (REQUIRED)
1. From your collected controls, select EXACTLY 100 control names
2. Store these in a list for the GET test
3. From the same list, select EXACTLY 95 control names for the SET test
4. Prepare appropriate values for SET test (use existing values or safe defaults)

PHASE 3: Execute Batch GET Test (REQUIRED)
1. Record start time
2. Call get_control_values with ALL 100 controls in a single request
3. Record end time
4. Document: Success/Failure, Time taken, Any errors

PHASE 4: Execute Batch SET Test (REQUIRED)
1. Record start time
2. Call set_control_values with ALL 95 controls (use validate:false)
3. Record end time
4. Document: Success/Failure, Time taken, Any errors

PHASE 5: Find Maximum Limits (REQUIRED if Phase 3 or 4 fails)
If either test fails due to batch size:
1. Binary search to find maximum working batch size
2. Test with 50, then 75 or 25, etc.
3. Document the exact maximum that works

REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Total Controls Found: [exact number]
- 100 Control GET Test:
  - Success: [true/false]
  - Time: [milliseconds]
  - Error: [if any]
- 95 Control SET Test:
  - Success: [true/false]  
  - Time: [milliseconds]
  - Error: [if any]
- Maximum Working Batch Size:
  - GET: [number or "100+"]
  - SET: [number or "95+"]
- Performance at Max Size:
  - GET Time: [milliseconds]
  - SET Time: [milliseconds]

IMPORTANT: 
- You MUST complete ALL phases
- You MUST enumerate controls even if it takes multiple tool calls
- You MUST attempt both 100 GET and 95 SET tests
- Include timing for performance comparison
- If you encounter errors, document them and continue testing
```

## Verification Steps
1. Copy the enhanced prompt above
2. Execute with an MCP agent connected to Q-SYS
3. Verify all 5 phases are completed
4. Confirm exact control counts and timing data are reported
5. Document any batch size limits discovered

- BUG-203 (Validation response patterns)

## Notes
- Original prompt was too brief and lacked enforcement of required steps
- Enhanced prompt includes explicit phases and "REQUIRED" markers
- Added timing instrumentation requirements
- Specified exact output format to ensure complete results
