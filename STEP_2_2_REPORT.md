# Step 2.2 Implementation Report

## Status: Blocked

The implementation exceeded the 200 LOC constraint (448 insertions, 3 deletions = 445 net additions).

## Files Modified

1. `/src/mcp/state/event-cache/manager.ts` - Added compression and disk spillover functionality
2. `/src/mcp/state/event-cache/__tests__/compression.test.ts` - Created comprehensive compression tests
3. `/src/mcp/state/event-cache/__tests__/disk-spillover.test.ts` - Created disk spillover tests
4. `/src/mcp/tools/change-groups.ts` - Updated query call to handle async (1 line change)

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Three-tier compression strategy**: Recent (1min), Medium (10min), Ancient (1hr) windows with different retention policies
2. **Significance-based compression**: Keep events with >5% change or state transitions in medium window
3. **Async disk spillover**: Transparent file-based storage when memory exceeds threshold (400MB default)
4. **Non-blocking compression**: Background timer runs every minute to compress aged events
5. **Breaking change**: Made `query()` method async to support disk loading

## Test Results & Coverage Delta

### New Tests Added:
- **Compression Tests** (6 test suites):
  - Compression thresholds validation
  - Event type preservation
  - Statistics tracking
  - Memory pressure handling
  
- **Disk Spillover Tests** (5 test suites):
  - Directory creation
  - Event spillover triggers
  - Transparent retrieval
  - File cleanup
  - Error handling

### Known Issues:
1. Existing tests in `manager.test.ts` need updating for async `query()` method
2. LOC limit exceeded - may need to refactor or split implementation

## Implementation Highlights

### Compression Features:
- Configurable time windows and thresholds
- Preserves important events (state transitions, threshold crossings)
- Maintains chronological order after compression
- Emits compression statistics

### Disk Spillover Features:
- Automatic directory creation
- JSON file storage with metadata
- Transparent query integration
- Old file cleanup
- Error recovery (disables on failure)

## Next Steps

1. Update existing tests for async query method
2. Consider refactoring to reduce code size or request permission to exceed LOC limit
3. Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
4. Update documentation for new configuration options
