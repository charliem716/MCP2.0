# Console Statements Report

## Summary

No console statements (console.log, console.error, console.warn, console.debug) were found in the production source code (`src/` directory).

## Detailed Findings

### Production Code (src/)
- **Total console statements found**: 0
- All production TypeScript files are clean of console statements

### Test Files
Console statements were found in test files, which is acceptable as they are not part of the production build:

#### TypeScript Test Files (.ts)
- `/tests/archived/bug-regression/bug-053-type-check.test.ts`: 1 occurrence (line 46)
- `/tests/archived/bug-regression/bug-054-type-safety.test.ts`: 2 occurrences (lines 23, 25)
- `/tests/archived/bug-regression/bug-048-verify.test.ts`: 1 occurrence (line 60)
- `/tests/setup.ts`: 6 occurrences (lines 10-11, 18-19, 24-25) - Jest test setup mocking console
- `/tests/unit/bug-023-console-fix.test.ts`: 2 occurrences (lines 20-21) - Testing for console statements
- `/tests/archived/bug-regression/bug-036-final-verification.test.ts`: 6 occurrences (lines 30-31, 59-60, 88-89)
- `/tests/unit/mcp/tools/status.test.ts`: 1 commented out occurrence (line 194)

#### JavaScript/MJS Test Files (.js, .mjs)
Multiple test files contain console statements for debugging and test output:
- `/tests/bug-046-simulation.mjs`
- `/tests/functional/mcp-control-test.js`
- `/tests/bug-046-comprehensive.mjs`
- `/tests/bug-030-performance-test.mjs`
- `/debug-adapter.mjs`
- `/tests/bug-024-verification.js`
- `/verify-fix.mjs`

### Other Files
- `/mcp-server-wrapper.js`: Contains a comment about not using console.error in MCP mode (line 38)

## Conclusion

The production codebase (`src/` directory) is completely clean of console statements, which indicates good code quality and proper logging practices. The console statements found in test files are appropriate for test output and debugging purposes.
