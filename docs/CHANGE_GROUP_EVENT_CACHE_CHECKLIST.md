## Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Complete Phase 2.2** - Implement compression for memory efficiency
2. **Complete Phase 4.3** - Write comprehensive documentation
3. **Start Phase 4.2** - Add load testing for production confidence
4. **Begin Phase 5** - Add advanced features based on user needs
5. **Plan Phase 6** - Prepare for production deployment

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Memory Growth** - Without compression, long-running systems may hit memory limits
   - Mitigation: Implement compression in Phase 2.2
   - Current workaround: Aggressive eviction policies

2. **Query Performance** - Complex queries on large datasets may be slow
   - Mitigation: Query optimization in Phase 2.3
   - Current workaround: Result limits and time range restrictions

3. **Documentation Gap** - Operators need clear guidance
   - Mitigation: Complete Phase 4.3 documentation
   - Current workaround: Code comments and test examples

The event cache system is **production-ready for basic use cases** but needs Phase 2-4 completion for full production deployment.
