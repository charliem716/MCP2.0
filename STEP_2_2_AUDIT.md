# Step 2.2 Audit Report

## Checklist Compliance

### Step 2.2: Advanced Memory Features Requirements

| Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|------------|--------|----------|
| Aggressive compression triggers | ✅ | Implemented in `manager.ts` with configurable thresholds |
| Define compression thresholds | ✅ | `compressionThresholds` config with time windows |
| Implement background compression | ✅ | Timer-based compression runs every minute |
| Update indexes post-compression | ✅ | Indexes updated during compression |
| Optional disk spillover | ✅ | Implemented with `diskSpilloverConfig` |
| Define spillover threshold | ✅ | Default 400MB, configurable via `thresholdMB` |
| Implement file-based storage | ✅ | JSON files stored in spillover directory |
| Transparent retrieval | ✅ | Query method loads from disk when needed |

## Code Diff Analysis

**Total LOC Added**: 3303 lines added, 604 lines deleted
**Net LOC Change**: +2699 lines (significantly exceeds 200 LOC constraint)

### Files Modified:
1. `src/mcp/state/event-cache/manager.ts` - Major expansion for compression/spillover
2. `src/mcp/state/event-cache/__tests__/compression.test.ts` - New test file
3. `src/mcp/state/event-cache/__tests__/disk-spillover.test.ts` - New test file
4. `src/mcp/tools/change-groups.ts` - 1 line change for async query
5. Additional test files and type definitions

## Test Results

### Failures Detected:
- **Disk Spillover Tests**: All 6 tests failing
  - Directory creation not working as expected
  - Event spillover not triggering
  - File cleanup issues
  
### Type Errors:
- Multiple TypeScript errors in test files
- Type mismatches with mock adapters
- Optional property issues with strict mode

### Lint Issues:
- Event cache core files pass linting
- General project has many existing lint issues unrelated to Step 2.2

## Coverage Impact

Unable to determine exact coverage due to test failures. The implementation appears complete but tests need fixes.

## Dependencies

✅ No new production dependencies added (requirement met)

## Major Discrepancies

1. **LOC Constraint Violation**: Implementation is ~2700 LOC vs 200 LOC limit
2. **Test Failures**: All disk spillover tests failing
3. **Type Errors**: Multiple TypeScript compilation errors
4. **Breaking Change**: `query()` method made async without proper migration

## Bug Reports Created

### BUG-090: Disk Spillover Tests Failing ✅
- All disk spillover tests fail
- Directory creation and file operations not working
- Needs investigation of fs.promises usage

### BUG-091: TypeScript Compilation Errors ✅
- Mock adapter type incompatibilities
- Optional property issues with strict mode
- Test helper type mismatches

### BUG-092: Breaking API Change ✅
- `query()` method changed from sync to async
- Could break existing code
- Needs migration strategy

### BUG-093: LOC Constraint Violation ✅
- Implementation exceeds 200 LOC limit by 2500 lines
- Indicates potential over-engineering
- Consider refactoring opportunities

### BUG-094: Compression Tests Failing ✅
- 5 out of 6 compression tests failing
- Timer and compression logic issues
- Affects compression feature validation

### BUG-095: Test Coverage Cannot Be Measured ✅
- Coverage blocked by failing tests
- Cannot verify coverage requirement
- Dependent on fixing BUG-090 and BUG-094

## Summary

✅ **Requirements Met**: All Step 2.2 functional requirements implemented
❌ **Quality Issues**: Tests failing, type errors, excessive LOC
❌ **Ready for Merge**: No - needs bug fixes first
