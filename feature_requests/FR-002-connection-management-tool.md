# Feature Request: Connection Management Tool

**FR-ID:** FR-002  
**Date:** 2025-01-12  
**Status:** Draft  
**Priority:** High  

## Executive Summary

Create a comprehensive MCP tool for managing, monitoring, and controlling the QRWC connection to Q-SYS Core. This tool will provide agents with visibility into connection health, the ability to trigger reconnection attempts, and advanced diagnostics for troubleshooting connectivity issues.

## Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points
1. **Limited Visibility**: Agents cannot determine why a connection failed or the current connection state details
2. **No Manual Control**: When auto-reconnect fails, agents have no way to trigger reconnection
3. **Insufficient Diagnostics**: No insight into retry attempts, connection history, or failure patterns
4. **Recovery Issues**: After Q-SYS Core restarts, the MCP server often requires manual restart
5. **No Connection Testing**: Cannot validate connection quality or latency

### User Impact
- Agents report "connection failed" errors without actionable information
- Users must manually restart MCP server after Core restarts
- Difficult to debug intermittent connection issues
- No way to proactively monitor connection health

## Proposed Solution

### Tool Name: `manage_connection`

### Core Capabilities

#### 1. Connection Status Reporting
```typescript
{
  action: "status",
  verbose?: boolean  // Include detailed diagnostics
}
```

Returns comprehensive connection information:
- Current state (connected, disconnected, connecting, reconnecting)
- Connection endpoint details (host, port, protocol)
- Health metrics (uptime, last successful connection, latency)
- Retry statistics (attempts, failures, success rate)
- Circuit breaker state
- Error history with timestamps and reasons

#### 2. Manual Reconnection Control
```typescript
{
  action: "reconnect",
  force?: boolean,      // Bypass circuit breaker
  maxAttempts?: number, // Override default retry count
  timeout?: number      // Connection timeout in ms
}
```

Allows agents to:
- Trigger immediate reconnection attempt
- Force reconnection even if circuit breaker is open
- Configure retry behavior for this attempt
- Monitor reconnection progress with real-time updates

#### 3. Connection Testing
```typescript
{
  action: "test",
  type?: "basic" | "latency" | "throughput" | "comprehensive",
  duration?: number  // Test duration in seconds
}
```

Performs various connection tests:
- **Basic**: Simple ping/pong to verify connectivity
- **Latency**: Measure round-trip time for commands
- **Throughput**: Test data transfer rates
- **Comprehensive**: Full suite of connection tests

#### 4. Connection Configuration
```typescript
{
  action: "configure",
  settings: {
    autoReconnect?: boolean,
    maxRetryAttempts?: number,
    retryInterval?: number,
    connectionTimeout?: number,
    circuitBreakerThreshold?: number
  }
}
```

Dynamically adjust connection parameters without restart

#### 5. Connection History & Analytics
```typescript
{
  action: "history",
  timeRange?: "1h" | "24h" | "7d" | "30d",
  eventType?: "all" | "connections" | "disconnections" | "errors"
}
```

Provides historical connection data:
- Connection/disconnection events with timestamps
- Error patterns and frequency
- Uptime/downtime statistics
- Performance trends

#### 6. Advanced Diagnostics
```typescript
{
  action: "diagnose",
  checks?: string[]  // Specific checks to run
}
```

Runs diagnostic checks:
- Network connectivity to Q-SYS Core
- DNS resolution
- Port accessibility
- Certificate validation (for WSS)
- WebSocket protocol compatibility
- Authentication status
- Resource availability (memory, file descriptors)

#### 7. Connection Reset
```typescript
{
  action: "reset",
  clearCaches?: boolean,
  resetCircuitBreaker?: boolean,
  resetStats?: boolean
}
```

Performs full connection reset:
- Closes existing connection cleanly
- Clears all caches
- Resets circuit breaker
- Clears error history
- Initiates fresh connection

### Additional Features

#### 8. Connection Monitoring Mode
```typescript
{
  action: "monitor",
  interval?: number,    // Polling interval in seconds
  duration?: number,    // Monitoring duration
  alerts?: {
    onDisconnect?: boolean,
    onHighLatency?: number,  // Threshold in ms
    onErrorRate?: number      // Threshold percentage
  }
}
```

Continuous monitoring with configurable alerts

#### 9. Predictive Maintenance
```typescript
{
  action: "predict",
  analyze?: "stability" | "performance" | "reliability"
}
```

Analyzes patterns to predict issues:
- Connection stability trends
- Performance degradation warnings
- Recommended configuration changes

#### 10. Multi-Core Support (Future)
```typescript
{
  action: "switch",
  target: {
    host: string,
    port?: number,
    credentials?: object
  }
}
```

Switch between different Q-SYS Cores without restart

## Implementation Architecture

### Component Structure
```
manage_connection tool
├── Connection Controller (actions: reconnect, reset, switch)
├── Status Reporter (actions: status, history)
├── Diagnostic Engine (actions: test, diagnose, predict)
├── Configuration Manager (actions: configure)
└── Monitor Service (actions: monitor)
```

### Key Interfaces
```typescript
interface ConnectionManagementResult {
  success: boolean;
  action: string;
  data?: any;
  error?: {
    code: string;
    message: string;
    details?: any;
  };
  metadata: {
    timestamp: string;
    duration: number;
    correlationId: string;
  };
}
```

### State Management
- Maintain connection event history in memory (last 1000 events)
- Persist critical metrics to disk for recovery
- Track performance baselines for anomaly detection

## Use Cases

### Primary Use Cases
1. **Troubleshooting Connection Issues**
   - Agent uses `diagnose` to identify root cause
   - Reviews `history` for error patterns
   - Attempts `reconnect` with adjusted parameters

2. **Proactive Monitoring**
   - Set up `monitor` mode during critical operations
   - Receive alerts on connection degradation
   - Use `predict` to anticipate issues

3. **Recovery from Core Restart**
   - Detect disconnection via `status`
   - Use `reconnect` with force flag
   - Validate recovery with `test`

### Secondary Use Cases
4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Run `test` suite to baseline performance
   - Adjust configuration based on results
   - Monitor improvements

5. **Multi-Environment Support**
   - Switch between development/production Cores
   - Maintain separate connection profiles
   - Quick failover capabilities
