## Major Issues 🟡

### 1. ESLint Warnings
**Total Issues**: 549 warnings (0 errors) - improved from 488 issues with 8 errors  

**Most Common Warnings**:
- `@typescript-eslint/prefer-nullish-coalescing` 
- `@typescript-eslint/no-unnecessary-condition`
- `@typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-*` operations
- `max-statements` exceeded in some files
- `complexity` threshold exceeded in some functions
- `@typescript-eslint/no-non-null-assertion`

### 2. Outdated Dependencies
**Count**: 15 dependencies have newer versions available  

**Major Version Updates Available**:
- `express`: 4.21.2 → 5.1.0
- `@types/express`: 4.17.23 → 5.0.3
- `@types/jest`: 29.5.14 → 30.0.0
- `@types/node`: 20.19.8 → 24.1.0
- `dotenv`: 16.6.1 → 17.2.1
- `husky`: 8.0.3 → 9.1.7
- `jest`: 29.7.0 → 30.0.5
- `zod`: 3.25.67 → 4.0.10

### 3. Large File Sizes
**Files Exceeding 500 Lines**:
- `src/mcp/state/event-cache/manager.ts` - 1,746 lines
- `src/mcp/tools/qsys-api.ts` - 1,339 lines
- `src/mcp/tools/controls.ts` - 995 lines
- `src/mcp/qrwc/adapter.ts` - 721 lines
- `src/mcp/tools/change-groups.ts` - 699 lines

## Code Quality Issues ⚠️

### 1. Complex Functions
**Files with High Complexity**:
- Several files exceed the max-statements limit (25)
- Some functions have cyclomatic complexity > 20
- Deep nesting in event handling code

### 2. Test Coverage Gaps
**Areas Needing More Coverage** (to reach 80% target):
- Branch coverage: 65.27% (need +14.73%)
- Function coverage: 72.89% (need +7.11%)
- Statement coverage: 73.3% (need +6.7%)
- Line coverage: 73.88% (need +6.12%)

### 3. Code Organization
**Issues Found**:
- Some test files are very large (manager.test.ts has 462 lines)
- Event cache manager needs refactoring (1,746 lines)
- Some files mix multiple responsibilities

## Security Audit ✅

### Resolved Issues
- ✅ OpenAI API key removed from `.env` file
- ✅ No secrets found in codebase

### Remaining Considerations
- Ensure proper secret management in production
- Consider implementing secret rotation
- Verify `.env` is in `.gitignore`

## Positive Findings ✅

### Major Improvements
- ✅ TypeScript build now working
- ✅ Test coverage more than doubled (35% → 73%)
- ✅ All TypeScript type errors resolved
- ✅ ESLint errors reduced to 0 (was 8)
- ✅ All tests passing (100% pass rate)

### Architecture
- Well-organized modular structure
- Clear separation of concerns (MCP, Q-SYS, API layers)
- Comprehensive documentation structure
- Strong TypeScript usage throughout

### Code Quality
- Minimal TODO comments
- No console.log statements in production code
- Consistent file naming conventions
- Good test organization

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (P0)
1. **Address ESLint Warnings**
   - Focus on auto-fixable issues first
   - Update code to use nullish coalescing
   - Remove unnecessary type assertions
   
2. **Reach 80% Test Coverage**
   - Add tests for uncovered branches
   - Focus on critical paths
   - Consider integration tests for Q-SYS
